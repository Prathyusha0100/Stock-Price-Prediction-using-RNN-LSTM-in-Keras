ðŸ“ˆ **Stock Price Prediction using RNN & LSTM**

This project builds a **time series prediction model** for **stock price forecasting** using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs** in **Keras**. The model leverages historical stock price data to predict future trends, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in financial time series forecasting.  

ðŸš€ Project Overview  
- Implemented **RNN & LSTM models** for stock price prediction.  
- Preprocessed stock market data with **normalization & sequence preparation**.  
- Trained the model using **Keras & TensorFlow** with adjustable hyperparameters.  
- Evaluated predictions using **Mean Squared Error (MSE) & RMSE metrics**.  

ðŸ“Œ Features
