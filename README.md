# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-RNN-LSTM-in-Keras
This project implements a time series prediction model for stock price forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is built using Keras &amp; TensorFlow, utilizing historical stock price data to predict future trends.
